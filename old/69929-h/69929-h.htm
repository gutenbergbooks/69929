</section>

<p>From up on the first level of the first shelf of the
wagon road above Avalanche Creek came the voice of Dad
Wheelis, the wagon-train boss, addressing his front span.
The mules had halted at the head of the steep grade to twist
about in the traces and, with six ’cello-shaped heads stretched
over the rim and twice that many somber eyes fixed on the abyss
swimming in a green haze beneath them, to contemplate its
outspread glories while they got their wind back. It became
evident that Dad thought the breathing space sufficiently had
been prolonged. On a beautiful clearness his words dropped down
through the spicy dry air.</p>

<p>“Git up!” he bade the sextet with an affectionate violence, and
you could hear his whip-lash where it crackled like a string of
firecrackers above the drooping ears of the lead team. “Git up,
you scenery-lovin’ <i>so-and-soes</i>!”</p>

<p>There was an agonized whine of tires and hubs growing faint and
then fainter and Mrs. Hector Gatling sighed with a profound
appreciation. “How prodigal nature is out in these Western
wilds!” she said.</p>

<p>“Certainly does throw a wicked prod,” agreed her daughter,
Miss Shirley Gatling. But her eyes were not fixed where her
mother’s were.</p>

<p>“Such a climate!” affirmed the senior lady, flinching slightly
that the argot of a newer and an irreverent generation
should be invoked in this cathedral place. “Such views! Such
picturesque types everywhere!”</p>

<p>“Not bad-looking mountains across over yonder, at that,” said
Mr. Gatling, husband and father of the above, giving his
gestured indorsement to an endless vista of serrated peaks of an
average height of not less than seven thousand feet. “Not bad at
all, so long as you don’t have to hoof up any of ’em.”</p>

<p>“<i>Mong père</i>, he also grows poetic, is it not?” murmured Miss
Gatling. “Now, who’d have ever thunk it, knowing him in his
native haunts back in that dear Pittsburgh!”</p>

<p>Her glance still was leveled in a different direction from the
one in which her elders gazed. Mr. Gatling twisted about so that
a foldable camp-chair creaked under his weight, and looked
through his glasses in the same quarter where his daughter
looked. His forehead drew into wrinkles.</p>

<p>Miss Gatling stood up, a slim, trim figure in her riding-boots
and her well-tailored breeches and with a gay little shirt drawn
snugly down inside her waistband and held there by a broad
brilliant girdle of squaw’s beadwork. She settled a large
sombrero on her bobbed hair and stepped away from them over the
pine-needles and thence down toward the roaring creek. The morning
sunlight came
slanting through the lower tree boughs and picked out and made
shiny glitters of the heavy Mexican silver spurs at her heels
and the wide Navaho silver bracelet that was set on her right
wrist. She passed between two squared boulders that might have
been the lichened tombs for a couple of Babylon’s kings.</p>

<p>“Continue, I pray you, dear parents, to sit and invite your
souls, if any,” she called back. “I go to make sure they’re
putting plenty of cold victuals in the lunch kit. Yesterday
noon, you’ll remember, we darn’ near starved. For you, the
beckon and the lure of the wonderland. But for me and my girlish
gastric juices&mdash;chow and lots of it!”</p>

<p>Mr. Gatling said nothing for a minute or two, but he took off
his cap as though to make more room for additional furrows
forming on his brow.</p>

<p>“Mmph!” he remarked presently. Mrs. Gatling emerged promptly
from her own reverie. It was his commonest way of engaging her
attention&mdash;that <i>mmphing</i> sound was. Lacking vowels though it did,
its emphasis of uneasiness was quite apparent to her schooled
ears.</p>

<p>“What’s wrong, dear?” she asked. “Still sore from all that
dreadful horseback riding?”</p>

<p>“It’s that girl,” he told her; “that Shirley of ours. She’s the
one I’m worried about.”</p>

<p>“Why, goodness gracious!” she cried. “What’s wrong with
Shirley?”</p>

<p>“Look at her. That’s all I ask&mdash;just look at her.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Gatling, who was slightly near-sighted in more ways than
one, squinted at the withdrawing figure.</p>

<p>“Why, the child never seemed happier or healthier in her life,”
she protested, still peering. “Why, only last Monday&mdash;or was it
Tuesday; no, Monday&mdash;I remember distinctly now it was Monday
because that was the day we got caught in the snowstorm coming
through Swift Current Pass&mdash;only last Monday you were saying
yourself how well and rosy she was looking.”</p>

<p>“I don’t mean that&mdash;she’s a bunch of limber young whalebones.
Look where she’s going! That’s what I mean. Look what she’s
doing!”</p>

<p>“Why, what is she doing that’s out of the way, I’d like to
know?” demanded his puzzled wife, now jealously on the defensive
for her young.</p>

<p>“She’s doing what she’s been doing every chance she got these
last four-five days, that’s what.” Mr. Gatling was manifesting
an attitude somewhat common in husbands and fathers when dealing
with their domestic problems. He preferably would flank the
subject rather than bore straight at it, hoping by these
roundabout tactics to obtain confirmation for his suspicions
before he ever voiced them. “Got eyes in your head, haven’t you?
All right then, use ’em.”</p>

<p>“Hector Gatling, for a sane man you do get the queerest notions
in your brain sometimes! What on earth possesses you? Hasn’t the
child a perfect right to stroll down there and watch those three
guides packing up? You know she’s been trying to learn to make
that pearl knot or turquoise knot or whatever it is they call
it. What possible harm can there be in her learning how to tie a
pearl knot?”</p>

<p>“Diamond hitch, diamond hitch,” he corrected her testily. “Not
pearls, but diamonds; not knots, but hitches! You’d better try
to remember it, too&mdash;diamonds and hitches usually figure in the
thing that I’ve got on my mind. And, if you’ll be so kind as to
observe her closely, you’ll see that it isn’t those three guides
she’s so interested in. It’s one guide out of the three. And
it’s getting serious, or I’m all wrong. Now then, do you get my
drift, or must I make plans and specifications?”</p>

<p>“Oh!” The exclamation was freighted with shock and with sorrow
but with incredulity too, and now she was fluttering her
feathers in alarm, if a middle-aged lady dressed in tweed
knickerbockers and a Boy Scout’s shirt may be said to have any
feathers to flutter. “Oh, Hector, you don’t mean it! You can’t
mean it! A child who’s traveled and seen the world! A child
who’s had every advantage that wealth and social position and
all could give her! A child who’s a member of the Junior League!
A child who’s&mdash;who Hector, you’re crazy. Hector, you know it’s
utterly impossible&mdash;utterly! It’s preposterous!” Womanlike, she
debated against a growing private dread. Then, still being
womanlike, she pressed the opposing side for proof to destroy
her counter-argument: “Hector, you’ve seen something&mdash;you’ve
overheard something. Tell me this minute what it was you
overheard!”</p>

<p>“I’ve overheard nothing. Think I’m going snooping around
eavesdropping and spying on Shirley? I’ve never done any of that
on her yet and I’m too old to begin now and too fat. But I’ve
seen a-plenty.”</p>

<p>“Oh, pshaw! I guess if there’d been anything afoot I’d have seen
it myself first what with my mother’s intuition and all! Oh,
pshaw!” But Mrs. Gatling’s derisive rejoinder lacked
conviction.</p>

<p>“I’ve had the feeling for longer than these last few days,”
continued Mr. Gatling despondently. “But I couldn’t put my hand
on it, not at first. I tried to fool myself by saying it was
this Wild Western flubdub and stuff getting into her blood and
she’d get over it, soon as the attack had run its course. First
loading up with all that Indian junk, then saying she felt as
though she never wanted to do anything but be natural and stay
out here and rough it for the rest of her life, and now here all
of a sudden getting so much more flip and slangy than usual.
That’s the worst symptom yet&mdash;that slang is.</p>

<p>“In your day, ma’am, when a girl fell in love or thought she
had, she went and got all mushed-up and sentimental; went
mooning around sentimentalizing and rhapsodizing and
romanticking and everything. All of you but the strong-minded
ones did and I guess they must have mushed-up some too, on the
sly. Yes’m, that’s what you did&mdash;you mushed-up.” His tone was
accusing, condemning, as though he dealt with ancient offenses
which not even the passage of the years might condone. “But now
it’s different with them. They get slangier and flippier and
they let on to make fun of their own affections. And that’s what
Miss Shirley is doing right now this very minute, or else I’m
the worst misled man in the entire state of Montana.”</p>

<p>“Maybe&mdash;maybe&mdash;&mdash;” The matron sputtered as her distress mounted.
“Of course I’m not admitting that you’re right, Hector&mdash;the mere
suggestion of such a thing is simply incredible&mdash;but on the bare
chance that the child might be getting silly notions into her
head maybe I’d better speak to her. I’m so much older than she
is that&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<hr class='tb'>

<p>“You said it then!” With a grim firmness Mr. Gatling
interrupted. “You’re so much older than she is; that’s your
trouble. And I’m suffering from the same incurable complaint.
People our age who’ve got children growing up go around bleating
that young people are different from the way young people were
when we were young. They’re not. They’re just the same as we
were&mdash;same impulses, same emotions, same damphoolishness, same
everything&mdash;but they’ve got a new way of expressing ’em. And then
we say we can’t understand them. Knock thirty years off of our
lives and we’d understand all right because then we’d be just
the same as they are. So you’ll not say a word to that youngster
of ours&mdash;not yet awhile, you won’t. Nor me, neither.” Grammar,
considered as such, never had meant very much to Mr. Gatling,
that masterful, self-educated man.</p>

<p>“But if I pointed out a few things to her&mdash;if I warned her&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Ma’am, you’ll perhaps remember your own daddy wasn’t so
terribly happy over the prospect when I started sparking you.
After I’d come courting and had gone on home again I guess it
was as much as the old man could do to keep from taking a shovel
and shoveling my tracks out of the front yard. But he had sense
enough to keep his mouth shut where you were concerned. Suppose
he’d tried to influence you against me, tried to break off the
match&mdash;what would have happened? You’d have thought you were
oppressed and persecuted and you’d have grabbed for me even
quicker than you did.”</p>

<p>“Why, Hector Gatling, I never grabbed&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I’m merely using a figure of speech. But no, he had too much
gumption to undertake the stern-father racket. He locked his jaw
and took it out in nasty looks and let nature take its course,
and the consequence was we got married in the First Methodist
church with bridesmaids and old shoes and kinsfolks and all the
other painful details instead of me sneaking you out of a back
window some dark night and us running off together in a side-bar
buggy. No, ma’am, if you’ll take a tip from an old retired
yardmaster of the Lackawanna, forty-seven years, man and boy,
with one road, you’ll&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You never worked a day as a railroad man and you know it.”</p>

<p>“Just another figure of speech, my dear. Understand now, you’re
to keep mum for a while and I keep mum and we just sit back in
our reserved seats up in the grand stand and see how the game
comes out. A nice polite quiet game of watchful waiting&mdash;that’s
our line and we’re both going to follow it. We’ll stand by for
future developments and then maybe I’ll frame up a little
campaign. With your valuable advice and assistance, of course!”</p>

<hr class='tb'>

<p>With a manner which she strove to make casual and unconcerned,
the disturbed Mrs. Gatling that day watched. It was the manner
rather of a solicitous hen with one lone chick, and she
continually oppressed by dreads of some lurking chicken-hawk. It
would have deceived no one who closely studied the lady’s
bearing and demeanor. But then, none in the party closely
studied these.</p>

<p>The camp dunnage being miraculously bestowed upon the patient
backs of various pack-animals, their expedition moved. They
overtook and passed Dad Wheelis and his crew, caravaning with
provender for the highway contractors on up under the
cloud-combing parapet of the Garden Wall, and behind them heard
for a while his frank and aboveboard reflections upon the
immediate ancestries, the present deplorable traits, the
darkened future prospects of his work stock. Soon they swung
away from the rutted wagon track and took the steeper horseback
trail and for hours threaded it like so many plodding ants
against the slant of a tilted bowl. They stopped at midday on a
little plateau fixed so high toward heaven that it was a
picture-molding on Creation’s wall above a vast mural of painted
buttes and playful cataracts and a straggling timber-line and
two jeweled glaciers.</p>

<p>They stretched their legs and uncramped their backs; they ate
and remounted and on through the afternoon single-filed along
the farther slope where a family herd of mountain-goats browsed
among the stones and paid practically no heed to them. They saw
a solitary bighorn ram with a twisted double cornucopia
springing out of his skull and likewise they saw a pair of
indifferent mule-deer and enough landscapes to fill all the
souvenir post-card racks of the world; for complete particulars
consult the official guide-book of Our National Playgrounds.</p>

<p>Evening brought them across a bony hip of the Divide to within
sight of the distant rear boundary of the governmental domain.
So they pitched the tents and coupled up the collapsible stove
there in a sheltered small cove in the Park’s back yard and
watched the sun go down in his glory. When the moon rose it was
too good to believe. You almost could reach up and jingle the
tambourines of little circling stars; anyhow, you almost thought
you could. It was a magic hour, an ideal place for lovemaking
among the young of the species. Realizing the which, Mrs. Gating
had a severe sinking and apprehensive sensation directly behind
the harness buckle on the ample belt which girthed her weary
form amidships. She’d been apprehensive all day but now the
sinking was more pronounced.</p>

<p>She strained at the tethers of her patience though until supper
was over and it was near hushabye-time for the tired forms of
the middle-aged. Within the shelter of their small tent she
spoke then to her husband, touching on the topic so steadfastly
uppermost in her brain.</p>

<p>“Oh, Hector,” she quavered, “I’m actually beginning to be afraid
you’re right. They’ve been together this livelong day. Neither
one of them had eyes for anything or anybody else. The way he
helped her on and off her horse! The way he fetched and carried
for her! And the way she let him do it! And they’re&mdash;they’re
together outside now. Oh, Hector!”</p>

<p>“They certainly are,” he stated. “Sitting on a slab of rock in
that infernal moonlight like a couple of feeble-minded
turtledoves. Why in thunder couldn’t it ’a’ rained tonight&mdash;good
and hard? Romola, I don’t want to harry you up any more than’s
necessary but you take, say, about two or three more nights like
this and they’re liable to do considerable damage to tender
hearts.”</p>

<p>“Don’t I know it? Oh-h, Hector!”</p>

<p>“Well, anyhow, I had the right angle on the situation before you
tumbled,” he said with a sort of melancholy satisfaction. “I can
give myself credit for that much intelligence anyhow.” It was
quite plain that he did.</p>

<p>He stepped, a broad shape in his thick pajamas and quilted
sleeping-boots, to the door flap and he drew the canvas back and
peeped through the opening.</p>

<p>The pair under discussion had found the night air turning chill
and their perch hard. They got up and stood side by side in the
shimmering white glow. Against a background of luminous
blue-black space, it revealed their supple figures in strong,
sharp relief. The youth made a handsome shadowgraph. His
wide-brimmed sugar-loaf hat; his blue flannel blouse; his Angora
chaps with wings that almost were voluminous enough for an
eagle’s wings; his red silk neckerchief reefed in by a carved
bone ring to fit a throat which Mr. Gatling knew to be
sun-tanned and wind-tanned to a healthy mahogany-brown; his
beaded, deep-cuffed gauntlets; his sharp-toed, high-heeled,
silver-roweled boots of a dude cowboy&mdash;they all matched and
modeled in with the slender waist and the flat thighs and the
sinewy broad shoulders and the alert head of the wearer.</p>

<p>His name was Hayes Tripler, but the other two guides generally
called him “Slick” and they looked up to him, for he had ridden
No Home, the man-killer, at last year’s Pendleton Round-up
and hoped this year to be in the bulldogging money over the line
at Calgary.</p>

<div id='i001' class='mt01 mb01 w001'>
  <img src='images/illus-001.jpg' alt='' style='width:100%'>
  <p class='caption'>
Hayes had ridden the man-killer at the Pendleton Round-up.
And three moonlight nights hand-running had their effect
on Shirley’s impressionable youth.
  </p>
</div>

<p>Within his limitations he was an exceedingly competent person
and given to deporting himself accordingly.</p>

<p>At this present moment he appeared especially well pleased with
his own self-cast horoscope. There was a kind of proud
proprietary aura all about him.</p>

<p>The watcher inside the tent saw a caressing arm slip from about
his daughter’s body and he caught the sounds but did not make
out the sense of words that passed between them. Then the two
silhouettes swung apart and the boy laughed contentedly and
flung an arm aloft in a parting salute and began singing a catch
as he went teetering off toward the spot where his mates of the
outfit already were making the low tilt of a tarpaulin roof
above them pulse to some very sincere snoring. But before she
betook herself to quarters, the girl bided for a long minute on
the verge of the cliff and looked off and away into the studded
void beyond her.</p>

<p>Mr. Gatling drew the flaps together in an abstracted way and
<i>mmphed</i> several times.</p>

<p>“Pretty dog-gone spry-looking young geezer at that,” he remarked
absently.</p>

<p>“Who?”</p>

<p>“Him.”</p>

<p>“You actually mean that cowboy?”</p>

<p>“None other than which.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Hector! That&mdash;that vulgarian, that country bumpkin, that
clodhopper!”</p>

<p>“Now hold on there, Romola. Let’s try to be just even if we are
prejudiced. All the clods that kid ever hopped you could put ’em
in your eye without interfering with your eyesight. He’s no
farm-hand; he’s a cow-hand or was before he got this job of
steering tourists around through these mountains&mdash;and that’s a
very different thing, I take it. And what he knows he knows
blame’ well. I wish I could mingle in with a horse the way he
does. When he gets in a saddle he’s riveted there but I only
come loose and work out of the socket. And I’d give about five
years off my life to be able to handle a trout-rod like he can.
I claim that in his departments he’s a fairly high-grade
proposition. He’s aware of it, too, but I don’t so much blame
him for that, either. If you don’t think well of yourself, who
else is going to?”</p>

<p>“Why, Hector Gatling, I believe you’re really&mdash;but no, you
couldn’t be! Look at the difference in their stations? Look at
their different environments! Look at their different
viewpoints!”</p>

<p>“I’m looking&mdash;just as hard as you are. You don’t get what I’m
driving at. I wouldn’t fancy having this boy for a son-in-law
any more than you would&mdash;although at that I’m not saying I
couldn’t maybe make some use of him in another capacity. Still,
you needn’t mind worrying so much about their respective
stations in life. I didn’t have any station in life to start
from myself&mdash;it was a whistling-post. And yet I’ve managed to
stagger along fairly well. I’d a heap rather see Shirley tied up
to pretty near any decent, ambitious, self-respecting young cuss
that came along than to have her fall for one of those
plush-headed lounge-lizards that keep hanging round her back
home. I know the breed. In my day they used to be
guitar-pickers&mdash;and some of ’em played a snappy game of Kelly
pool. Now they’re Charleston dancers and the only place most of
’em carry any weight is on the hip.</p>

<p>“But that’s not the point. The point is that if Shirley fell for
this party she’d probably be a mighty regretful young female
when the bloom began to rub off the peach. They haven’t been
raised to talk the same language&mdash;that’s the trouble. I don’t
want her to make a mistake that’ll gum up her life before it’s
fairly started. I don’t want her to have a husband that she’s
liable later on to be ashamed to show him off before the
majority of her friends, or anyhow one that she’d maybe have to
go around making excuses for the way he handled his knife and
fork in company; or something. Right now, the fix she’s in,
she’s probably saying to herself that she could be perfectly
satisfied to settle down in a cabin somewhere out here and
wet-nurse a lot of calves for the next thirty, forty or fifty
years. But that’s only her heart talking, not her head. After a
while she’d get to brooding on Palm Beach and Paris.”</p>

<p>“But if she’s set her mind&mdash;and you know how stubborn she is when
she gets her mind set&mdash;thank heavens she didn’t get that from my
side of the family!&mdash;I say, if she’s set her mind on him, heavens
above only knows what’s going to happen. She’s bewitched, she’s
hypnotized; it’s this free and easy Western life that’s
fascinated her. I can’t believe she’s in love with him!”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know. Maybe she’s in love with a half-gallon hat
and a pair of cowboy pants with silver dewdabs down the sides,
or then again on the other hand maybe it’s the real thing with
her, or a close imitation of it. That’s for us to find out if we
can.”</p>

<p>“I won’t believe it. She’s distracted, she’s glamoured,
she’s&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“All right, then, let’s get her unglammed.”</p>

<p>“But how?”</p>

<p>“Well, for one thing, by not rushing in and interfering with her
little dream. By not letting either one of ’em see how anxious
we are over this thing. By remaining as calm, cool and collected
as we can.”</p>

<p>“And in the meanwhile?”</p>

<p>“Well, in the meanwhile I, for one, am going to tear off a few
winks. I hurt all over and there’s quite a lot of me measured
that way&mdash;all over.”</p>

<p>“You can go to sleep with that&mdash;that dreadful thought hanging
over us?”</p>

<p>“I can and I will. Watch me for about another minute and you’ll
hear me doing it.” He settled himself on his air mattress and
drew the blankets over him.</p>

<p>Undeniably Mr. Hector Gatling could be one of the most
aggravating persons on earth when he set out to be. Any husband
can.</p>

<hr class='tb'>

<p>Speaking with regard to the ripening effect of summer nights
upon the spirits of receptive and impressionable youth, Mr.
Gatling had listed the cumulative possibilities of three moonlit
ones hand-running. Specifically he had not included in his
perilous category those languishing soft gloamings and those
explosive sunrises and those long lazy mornings when the sun
baked resiny perfumes out of the cedars and the unseen
heart-broken little bird that the mountaineers call the lonesome
bird sang his shy lament in the thickets; nor had he mentioned
slow journeys through deep defiles where ferns grew with a
tropical luxuriance; nor yet the fordings of tumbling streams
when it might seem expedient on the part of a thoughtful young
man to steady a young equestrian of the opposite sex while her
horse’s hoofs fumbled over the slick, drowned boulders. But
vaguely he had lumped all these contingencies in his symposium
of contributory dangers.</p>

<p>Three more nights of moon it was with three noble days of
pleasant adventuring in between; and on the late afternoon of
the third day when camp was being made beside a river which
mostly was rapids, Miss Shirley Gatling sought out her father in
a secluded spot somewhat apart from the rest. It was in the
nature of a rendezvous, she having told him a little earlier
that presently she desired to have speech with him. Only, her
way of putting it had been different.</p>

<p>“Harken, O most revered Drawing Account,” she said, dropping
back on a broad place in the trail to be near him. “If you can
spare the time from being saddle-sore I want to give you an
earful as soon as this procession, as of even date, breaks up.
You pick a quiet retreat away from the flock and wait there
until I find you, savvy?”</p>

<p>So now he was waiting, and from yonder she came toward him
stepping lightly, swinging forward from her hips with a sort of
impudent freedom of movement; and to his father’s eyes she never
had seemed more graceful or more delectable or more independent
looking.</p>

<p>“Dad,” she began, without preamble, and meeting him eye to eye,
“in me you behold a Sabine woman. I’m bespoken.”</p>

<p>“Mmph,” he answered, and the answer might be interpreted, by a
person who knew him, in any one of half a dozen ways.</p>

<p>“Such is the case,” she went on, quite unafraid. “That caveman
over there in the blue shirt”&mdash;she pointed&mdash;“he’s the nominee.
We’re engaged.”</p>

<p>“I can’t plead surprise, kid,” he stated, taking on for the
moment her bantering tone. “The report that you two had come to
a sort of understanding has been in active circulation on this
reservation for the past forty-eight hours or so&mdash;maybe longer.”</p>

<p>Her eyebrows went up. “I don’t get you,” she said. “Who
circulated it?”</p>

<p>“You did, for one,” he told her. “And he did, for another. I may
be failing, what with increasing age and all, but I’m not more
than half blind yet. Have you been to your mother with this
piece of news?”</p>

<p>“I came to you first. I&mdash;I”&mdash;for the first time she faltered an
instant&mdash;“I figured you might be able to get the correct slant a
little quicker then she would. This is only the curtain-raiser.
I’m saving the big scene with the melodramatic touches for her.
I have a feeling that she may be just a trifle difficult. So I
picked on something easy to begin with.”</p>

<p>“I see,” he said. “Kind of an undress rehearsal, eh?” He held
her off at arm’s length from him, studying her face hungrily.
“But what’s the reason your young man didn’t come along with you
or ahead of you, in fact? In my time it generally was the young
man that brought the message to Garcia.”</p>

<p>“He wanted to come&mdash;he wasn’t scared. I wouldn’t let him. I told
him I’d been knowing you longer than he had and I could handle
the job better by myself. Well, that’s your cue. What’s it going
to be, daddy&mdash;the glad hand of approval and the parental bless
you my children, bless you, or a little line of that
go-forth-ungrateful-hussy-and-never-darken-my-doors-again
stuff? Only, we’re a trifle shy on doors around here.”</p>

<p>He drew her to him and spoke downward at the top of her cropped
head, she snuggling her face against his wool-clad breast.</p>

<p>“Baby,” he said, “when all’s said and done, the whole thing’s up
to you, way I look at it. I don’t suppose there ever was a man
who really loved his daughter but what he figured that, taking
one thing with another, she was too good for any man on earth.
I’m not saying now what sort of a husband I’d try to pick out
for you if the choice had been left to me. I’d probably want to
keep you an old maid so’s I could have you around and then I’d
secretly despise myself for doing it, too. What I’m saying is
this: If you’re certain you know your own mind and if you’ve
decided that this boy is the boy you want, why what more is
there for me to do except maybe to ask you just one or two small
questions?”</p>

<p>“Shoot!” she bade, without looking up, but her arms hugged him a
little tighter. “Probably one of the nicest old meal-tickets in
the world,” she added, confidentially addressing the top
buttonhole of his sweater.</p>

<p>“Has it by any chance entered into your calculations at this
early stage of the game, how you are going to live&mdash;you two? Or
where? Or, if I may be so bold, what on?”</p>

<p>“That’s easy,” she said, and now she was peering up at him
through a tousled short forelock. “You’re going to set us up on
a place out here somewhere&mdash;a ranch. We’re going to raise beef.
He knows about beef. And I’m going to learn. I aim to be the
leading lady beefer of the Imperial Northwest.”</p>

<p>“Whose notion was that?” His voice had sharpened the least bit.</p>

<p>“Mine, of course. He doesn’t know anything about it. His idea is
that we start in on what he can earn. But my idea is that we
start in on a few of the simoleons that have already been
earned&mdash;by you. And that’s the idea that’s going to prevail.”</p>

<p>“Lucky I brought a fountain pen and a check-book along,” he
said. “Nothing like being prepared for these sudden emergencies.
Still, I take it there’s no great rush. Now, I tell you what:
You run along and locate your mother and get <i>that</i> over with.
She knows how I stand&mdash;we’ve been discussing this little affair
our own selves.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” she said. “Oh, you have?” She seemed disappointed
somehow&mdash;disappointed and slightly puzzled.</p>

<p>“Oh yes, several times. And on your way kindly whisper to the
young man that I’m lurking right here behind these rocks ready
to have a few words with him.”</p>

<p>“Righto!” She reached up and kissed him and went swinging away,
and for just a moment Mr. Gatling’s conscience smote him.</p>

<p>“I’ve got to do it,” he said to himself, excusing himself. “I’ve
just got to find out&mdash;for her sake and ours&mdash;yes, and for his,
too. It looks like an impossible bet and I’ve got to make sure.”</p>

<hr class='tb'>

<p>With young Tripier he had more than the few words he had
specified. They had quite an interview and as they had it the
youth’s embarrassment, which at the outset of the dialog had
made him wriggle and mumble and kick with his toes at
inoffensive pebbles, gradually wore off until it vanished
altogether and his native assurance reasserted itself. A
proposition was advanced. It needed little pressing; promptly he
fell in with it. It appealed to him.</p>

<p>“So we’re agreed there,” concluded his prospective
father-in-law, clinching the final rivets. “We’ll all go right
ahead and finish out this tour&mdash;it’s only a couple of days more
anyhow. Then I’ll take Shirley and her mother and run on out to
Spokane. We’ll hustle one of the other boys back tomorrow to the
entrance to tell my chauffeur to load some bags in the car and
run around to this side and meet us where we come out. We’ll
leave you there and you can dust back to the starting point
through that short cut over the Garden Wall you were just
speaking of. The business that I’ve got in Spokane will keep me
maybe two or three days. That’ll give you time to get those new
clothes of yours and then we’ll all meet over at Many
Glacier&mdash;I’ll wire you in advance&mdash;and in a day or two we’ll all
go on East together so’s you can get acquainted with Shirley’s
friends and so forth. But of course, as I said before, that’s
our secret&mdash;all that part of it is. You’ve never been East, I
believe?”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ve been as far as Minot, North Dakota.”</p>

<p>“You’ll probably notice a good deal of territory the other side
of there. You’ll enjoy it. Sure you can pick up all the wardrobe
you need out in this country?” His manner was solicitous.</p>

<p>“Oh yes, sir, there’s those two swell fellows named Steinfelt
and Immergluck I was telling you about that they’ve got the
leading gents’ furnishing goods store down in Cree City.”</p>

<p>“Good enough! I’d suggest that when picking out a suit you get
something good and brisk as to pattern. Shirley likes live
colors.” Mr. Gatling next stressed a point which already had
been dwelt upon: “You understand of course that she’s not to
know a single thing about all this&mdash;it’s strictly between us
two?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“You see, that’ll make the surprise all the greater when she
sees you all fixed up in a snappy up-to-date rigging like young
college fellows your age wear back where she comes from. Seems
like to me I was reading in an advertisement only here the other
day where they’re going in for coats with belts on ’em this
season. Oh yes, and full-bottomed pants; I read that, too.</p>

<p>“One thing more occurs to me: Your hair is a little bit long and
shaggy, don’t you think? That’s fine for out here but back East
a young fellow that wants to be in style keeps himself trimmed
up sort of close. Now I saw a barber working on somebody about
as old as you are just the other day. Let me see&mdash;where was it?
Oh yes, it was the barber at that town of Cree City&mdash;I dropped in
there for a shave when we motored down last week. He seemed to
have pretty good ideas about trimming up a fellow’s bean, that
barber.”</p>

<p>“I know the one you mean&mdash;Silk Sullivan. I’ve patronized him
before.”</p>

<p>“That’s the one. Well, patronize him again before you rejoin us.
He knows his business all right, your friend Sullivan does....
Now, mind you, mum’s the word. All this part of it is absolutely
between us.”</p>

<p>“Oh yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“O. k. Shake on it.... Well, suppose we see how they’re coming
along with supper.”</p>

<hr class='tb'>

<p>Mr. Gatling’s strategy ticked like a clock. After they got to
Spokane he delayed the return by pretending a vexatious
prolongation of a purely fictitious deal in ore properties, his
privy intent being to give opportunity for Cree City’s
ready-made clothing princes to work their will. Since a hellish
deed must be done he craved that they do it properly. Then on
the homeward journey when they had reached the Western Gate, he
suddenly remembered he had failed to complete his purchases of
an assortment of game heads at Lewis’s on Lake McDonald. He
professed that he couldn’t round out the order by telephone;
unless he personally checked his collection some grievous error
might be made.</p>

<p>“You go on across on this train, Shirley,” he said. “I
telegraphed your young man that we’d be there this morning and
he’ll be on the lookout. Your mother and I’ll dust up to the
head of the lake on the bus and I’ll finish up what I’ve got to
do there and we’ll be along on the Limited this evening. After
being separated for a whole week you two’ll enjoy a day together
without any old folks snooping around. Meet us at the hotel
tonight.”</p>

<p>So Shirley went on ahead. It perhaps was true that Shirley’s
nerves had suffered after six days spent in the companionship of
a devoted mother who trailed along with yearning, grief-stricken
eyes fixed on her only child&mdash;a mother who at frequent intervals
sniffed mournfully. Quite willingly Shirley went.</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I feel as though I were giving her up forever,” faltered Mrs.
Gatling, following with brimming eyes her daughter’s departing
form.</p>

<p>“Romola,” commanded Mr. Gatling, “don’t be foolish in the head.
You’re going to be separated from her exactly nine hours.”</p>

<p>“But she tripped away so gaily&mdash;so gladly. It was exactly as
though she wanted to leave us. And yet, heavens knows I’ve tried
and tried ever since that&mdash;that terrible night to show her what
she means to me&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You’ve done more than try, Romola&mdash;you’ve succeeded, if that’s
any consolation to you. You’ve succeeded darned well.” He stared
almost regretfully down the line at the rear of an
observation-car swiftly diminishing into a small square dot
where the rails came together. “Since you mention it, she did
look powerfully chipper and cheerful a minute ago, hustling to
climb aboard that Pullman&mdash;cheerfuller than she’s looked since
we quit the trail last Wednesday. Lord, how I wish I could
guarantee that kid was never going to have a minute’s
unhappiness the rest of her life!” Something remotely akin to
remorse was beginning to gnaw at Mr. Gatling’s heart cockles.</p>

<hr class='tb'>

<p>Indeed, something strongly resembling remorse beset him toward
the close of this day. At the station when they detrained, no
Shirley was on hand to greet them; nor was there sign of
Shirley’s affianced, either. Up the slope from the tracks at the
hotel a clerk wrenched himself from an importuning cluster of
newly-arrived tourists for long enough to tell them Miss Gatling
had left word she would be awaiting them in their rooms and
wished them to come up immediately.</p>

<p>So they went up under escort of two college students serving as
bell-hops. A bedroom door opened and out came Shirley&mdash;a
crumpled, wobegone Shirley with a streaky swollen face.</p>

<p>“It’s all right, mater,” she said with a flickering trace of her
usual jauntiness. “The alliance between the house of Gatling and
the house of Tripier is off. So you can liven up. I’ll be your
substitute for such crying as is done in this family during the
next day or two. I’ve&mdash;I’ve been practising all afternoon.”</p>

<p>She eluded the lady’s outstretched arms and clung temporarily at
her father’s breast.</p>

<p>“Dad,” she confessed brokenly, “I think I must have been a
little bit loony these last two weeks. But, dad, I’ve taken the
cure. It’s not nice medicine and it makes you feel miserable
at first but I guess it’s good for what ails me.... Dad, have
you seen&mdash;him?”</p>

<p>“Not yet.” Compassion for her was mixed in with his own secret
exultation, as though he tasted a sweet cake that was iced with
a most bitter icing.</p>

<p>“Well, when you do, you’ll understand. Even if he doesn’t!”</p>

<p>“Have you told him?”</p>

<p>“Of course I have. Did you think I’d try to wish that little job
off on you? I didn’t tell him the real reason&mdash;I couldn’t wound
him that much. I told him I’d changed. But he&mdash;he’s really the
one that’s changed. That’s what makes it harder for me now.
That’s what makes it hurt so.”</p>

<p>“Here, Romola,” he said, kissing the girl and relinquishing her
into her mother’s grasp. “You swap tears awhile&mdash;you’ll enjoy
that anyhow, Romola. I’ve got business downstairs&mdash;got to make
some sleeper reservations for getting out of here in the
morning. And as soon as we hit Pittsburgh I figure you two had
better be booking up for a little swing around Europe.”</p>

<hr class='tb'>

<p>The lobby below was seething&mdash;seething is the word commonly used
in this connection so we might as well do so, too&mdash;was seething
with Easterners who mainly had dressed as they imagined
Westerners would dress, and with Westerners who mainly had
dressed as they imagined Easterners would dress, the resultant
effect being that nobody was fooled but everybody was pleased.
Working his way through the jam on the search for a certain one,
Mr. Gatling’s eye almost immediately was caught by a startling
color combination or rather a series of startling color
combinations appertaining to an individual who stood half hidden
by a column, leaning against it, head down, with his back to Mr.
Gatling.</p>

<p>To begin at the top, there was, surmounting all, a smug
undersized object of head-gear&mdash;at least, it would pass for
head-gear&mdash;of a poisonous mustard shade. It perched high and, as
it were, aloof upon the crest of its wearer’s skull. Below it,
where the neck had been shaved, and a good portion of the
close-clipped scalp as well, showed a sort of crescent of pink
skin blazing forth in strong contrast to the abnormally long
expanse of sunburnt surface rising above the cross-line of an
exceedingly low, exceedingly shiny pink linen collar.</p>

<p>Straying on downward, Mr. Gatling’s wondering eye was aware of a
high-waisted Norfolk jacket belted well up beneath the armpits,
a garment of a tone which might not be called mauve nor yet
lavender nor yet magenta but which partook subtly of all three
shades&mdash;with a plaid overlay in chocolate superimposed thereon.
Yet nearer the floor was revealed a pair of trousers extensively
bell-bottomed and apparently designed with the intent to bring
out and impress upon the casual observer the fact that their
present owner had two of the most widely bowed legs on the North
American continent; and finally, a brace of cloth-top shoes. Tan
shoes, these were, with buttoned uppers of a pale fawn cloth,
and bulldog toes. They were very new shoes, that was plain, and
of an exceedingly bright and pristine glossiness.</p>

<p>This striking person now moved out of his shelter, his shoulders
being set at a despondent hunch, and as he turned about,
bringing his profile into view, Mr. Gatling recognized that the
stranger was no stranger and he gasped.</p>

<p>“Perfect!” he muttered to himself; “absolutely perfect! Couldn’t
be better if I’d done it myself. And, oh Lordy, that
necktie&mdash;that’s the finishing stroke! Still, at that, it’s a
rotten shame&mdash;the poor kid!”</p>

<p>He hurried across, overtaking the slumped figure, and as his
hand fell in a friendly slap upon one drooped shoulder the
transformed cowboy looked about him with two sad eyes.</p>

<p>“Howdy-do, sir,” he said wanly. Then he braced himself and
squared his back, and Mr. Gatling perceived&mdash;and was glad to
note&mdash;that the youngster strove to take his heartache in a manly
fashion.</p>

<p>“Son,” said Mr. Gatling, “from what I’m able to gather I’m not
going to have you for a son-in-law after all. But that’s no
reason why we shouldn’t hook up along another line. I’ve been
watching you off and on ever since we got acquainted and more
closely since&mdash;well, since about a week ago, and it strikes me
you’ve got some pretty good stuff in you. I’ve been thinking of
trying a little flier in the cattle game out here. If you think
you’d like a chance to start in as foreman or boss or
superintendent or whatever you call it and maybe work up into a
partnership if you showed me you had the goods, why, we’ll talk
it over together at dinner. The womenfolks won’t be down and we
can sit and powwow.”</p>

<p>“I’d like that fine, sir,” said young Tripier.</p>

<p>“Good boy! I’ll keep you so busy you won’t have time to brood on
any little disappointment that you may be suffering from
now.... Say, son, don’t mind my suggesting something, do you? If I was
you I’d climb out of these duds you’ve got on and climb back
into your regular working clothes&mdash;you don’t seem to match the
picture the way you are now.”</p>

<p>“Why, you advised me to get ’em your own self, sir!” exclaimed
the youth.</p>

<p>“That’s right, I did, didn’t I? Well, maybe you had better keep
on wearing ’em.” A shrewd and crafty gleam flickered under his
eyelids. “You see&mdash;yes&mdash;on second thoughts, I think I want a
chance to get used to you in your stylish new outfit. Promise me
you’ll wear ’em until noon tomorrow anyhow?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” said his victim obediently.</p>

<p>Mr. Gatling winked a concealed, deadly wink.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='all:initial; display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='all:initial; display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='all:initial; display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='all:initial; display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='all:initial; display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='all:initial; display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='all:initial; display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='all:initial; display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='all:initial; display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='all:initial; display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
